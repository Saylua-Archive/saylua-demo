        Although Saylua was primarily created by Mike and Tiff, the game would not
        have been possible without the contributions of many individuals.

        Most of the art for Saylua, including the pet art, was wonderfully drawn
        by <a href="http://www.chutkat.com/">Chutkat</a> who also designed the overall
        visual style for the site.

      <p>
        The world of Saylua was brought to life through the beautiful environment
        illustrations of <a href="http://lyraina.com">Lyraina</a>.

        The logo for Saylua was created by <a href="http://irianwhitefox.deviantart.com/">

        Many early programming contributions to the project were
        created by <a href="http://noisek.com/">Noi Sek</a> who particularly helped with
        getting our Adventure feature off the ground.
